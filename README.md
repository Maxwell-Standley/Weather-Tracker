# Java Weather tracker
## A FULLY FUNCTIONING WEATHER TRACKER THAT SENDS UPDATES EVERY 3 HOURS TO YOUR TASKBAR IN WINDOWS

This project is a project I had picked up to practice my Java and learn how to do API calls. It shows how to send,
receive, and parse the data coming in.

* The data is received as JSON
* The data is parsed and sent to your navbar via the cloud icon
* This will be updated every 3 hours
* It shows the weather conditions and temperature outside.

## How to install this project for users

The easiest way  to do this is as follows: 

* Download java jdk 21 at the following link: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk21-windows
* Install Java in the default path for simplicity
* Open and run the "Weather tracker" java file.
## How to adjust this for your own use

Feel free to adjust or edit the code as you need! It can easily be changed to update when you specify. The location is set to a random city in Minnesota, United States.

If you would like to do so, follow these steps:

* Replace line 27's "API URL insert" with your URL.

If you would like to make it update more frequently or less frequently: 

* Open the WeatherTracker file
